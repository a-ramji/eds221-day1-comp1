## EDS 221 Day 1

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

practicing making file paths

## Read in data from a file that is not downstream

use ".." to hop back one level in our working directory ! :)

use as many as you need! ex: "../../../../" hops back 4 levels

```{r}
energy2 <- read_csv("../data/us_energy.csv")
```
